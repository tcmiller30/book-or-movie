# Which Is Better: The Book or The Movie?

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This website is for users who are looking to watch a new movie or read a new book, but don't know which one to start with. If the user is indecisive, they can use this website to search for the work of their choosing and get the internet's opinion of each the book and the movie adaptations of that work. The user will have the ratings of each medium returned and displayed to them, and the website will compare each value and recommend whichever has the highest of the two scores.

This project was created collaboratively with a team of 5 using a GitHub Repository; this gave us practice with using GitHub features like Branches, Pull Requests, and Merge Conflicts/Resolutions.

We also became much more familiar with the use of server-side API's using fetch requests and fulfilling the promises created by those requests.

## Usage

In order to use this website, first open up the webpage (deployed site) in your browser. From there, you will be prompted to enter the title of either a work, either a book or a movie. When your search is entered, the website will use the OMDB and the Open Library API's to gather data on the given title.

The Website will then display the book cover and the movie poster below the search box. Below that, the average book and movie's user ratings will display out of 10 and rounded to the nearest tenth place. The values will then be compared to determine which version the Internet views more favorably. 

The result of the search will then be outputted below the ratings. The website will recommend to the user whichever work has the higher average score, letting the user know which they should prioritize checking out first.

Each recommendation prompted by the User's search will be logged and saved to Local Storage so that the user can keep track of past searches.

Below is an example photo of how the Book or Movie Website will appear when the user has searched for a title.
